	// Items available from Kiosks that are available to a specific character as opposed to the account as a whole. It must be combined with data from the profileKiosks property to get a full picture of the character's available items to check out of a kiosk.  This component returns information about what Kiosk items are available to you on a *Character* level. Usually, kiosk items will be earned for the entire Profile (all characters) at once. To find those, look in the profileKiosks property.  COMPONENT TYPE: Kiosks

	// Information about instanced items across all returned characters, keyed by the item's instance ID.  COMPONENT TYPE: [See inside the DestinyItemComponentSet contract for component types.]
